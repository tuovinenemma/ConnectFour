# Weekly reports: Week Six

Time spent: 10 hours

### What did I do:

I decided to redo the start and end screen since I wasn't satisfied with my initial attempt. Although I began implementing the Alpha-Beta algorithm, I ended up restarting the process from scratch. However, I believe that this decision will ultimately lead to a better final product and greater satisfaction with the program.

## What did I find difficult:

It was challenging to come to terms with the fact that I needed to start over with a few tasks that I had almost completed, and as a result, I felt like I had "wasted" time this week. However, upon reflection, I realize that this was necessary to acknowledge that my initial approach to programming was flawed. Instead of focusing solely on step-by-step progress, I should have considered the full product from the outset.
  
### What I will do next:

I will complete the alpha-beta algorithm and GUI, both of which I restarted from scratch. Additionally, I plan to conduct proper testing to ensure the program's functionality.
