# Weekly reports: Week Six

Time spent: 10 hours

### What did I do:

I decided to redo the start and end screen since I wasn't satisfied with my initial attempt. Although I began implementing the Alpha-Beta algorithm, I ended up restarting the process from scratch. However, I believe that this decision will ultimately lead to a better final product and greater satisfaction with the program.
  
### What I will do next:

I will complete the alpha-beta algorithm and GUI, both of which I restarted from scratch. Additionally, I plan to conduct proper testing to ensure the program's functionality.
