# Weekly reports: Week One

Time spent: 6 hours

### What did I do:

I used most of the time just deciding on the subject and researching the different algorithms. After going through a lot of different subjects and algorithms I decided to not go with my original choice and instead I picked Connect Four. The algorithm that I chose was minimax- and alpha-beta-algorithm. I think this is the most suitable approach for this kind of game. I also created a reporsitory for this project and started to plan how I'm going to execute this.

### What will I do next:

Next I'm going to start programming the base of the program.
