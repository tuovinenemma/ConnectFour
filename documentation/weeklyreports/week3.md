# Weekly reports: Week Three

Time spent: 6 hours

### What did I do:

I didn't have a lot of time this week to spend on this project because of exams. The time that I had I spent trying to get codecov to work correctly. That was not succesfull because there was always some kind of problem with the building. After spending way too much time trying to figure that one out I got a bit frustrated so I decited to move on. Because of the limited time this week I decited it would the best to just research more on the minimax algorithm so that I understand it on a deeper level. 

### What did I have difficulties with:

Codecov.. Still did not get it to work correctly with the CI pipeline.
  
### What I will do next:

Next I will create start and end screen for the game so it looks a bit nicer. Then I will start on the minimax algorithm.
