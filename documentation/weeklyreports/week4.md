# Weekly reports: Week Four

Time spent: 10 hours

### What did I do:
I have started the development of the minimax algorithm, with the aim of creating an AI player to compete against a human player. I began by implementing the foundational components, such as determining the scores for different positions on the game board. The implementation of the minimax algorithm is now in its final stages and is almost ready for deployment.
  
### What I will do next:

I plan to complete the implementation of the minimax algorithm, and then move on to the alpha beta algorithm. After that I am going to focus on the GUI to make it feel a bit more like a fully completed game. I will have to divide my folders accordingly.
