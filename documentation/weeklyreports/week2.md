# Weekly reports: Week Two

Time spent: 12 hours

### What did I do:

I established the foundation for the program. The game is now playable for two players taking turns. I initially designed a program that allows players to choose a number from 0-6 to place their coin in the designated column. After the program was functional, I focused on enhancing it with a graphical user interface (GUI). I aimed to replicate the classic appearance of the Connect Four game for an authentic experience.

### What did I learn:

Programming the game's foundation was straightforward, as I have prior experience creating games with Pygame. Nonetheless, I encountered some new commands that I learned to use.
  
### What I will do next:

Next I'm going to to continue developing the details of the game and start generating the minimax-algorithm.
