# Project Specification

This project will be coded in Python. The project documentation will be in English.

The project is for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

## Topic

The goal of this project is to create a Connect 4 game using the Python programming language. The game will have a graphical user interface and will be able to be played by two players. The game will include standard Connect 4 rules, and will be able to detect a win or a draw.

The program will take input from the players through the GUI, including the movement of pieces and the selection of options such as "restart" or "quit". The program will validate the players' moves and enforce the rules of Connect 4.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

The game will use object-oriented programming principles to create classes for the game board and the game logic. The game will also use the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI player. The game state will be represented using a 2D array.


## Time and space complexity

The time complexity for the game should be O(n), where n is the total number of possible moves in a given position. The space complexity should be O(1), as the game state will be represented using a 2D array.
